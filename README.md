# SVDVisualization
If you input a vector from R^3 and a 3x3 matrix, it decompose the matrix(U, Sigma, V^T) and visualizes it(rotation(can contain reflection) from V^T -> scaling from Sigma, and rotataion from U). It is not optimized at all as the whole code is from my best friends GPT-chan and Gemini-chan.
